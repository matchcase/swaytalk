#+TITLE:SwayTalk - Control Sway/i3 with Natural Language ✨
SwayTalk leverages Ollama and Langchain to let you control Sway or i3 with Natural Language!
* Usage
You will need to have ~Ollama~ installed and running with ~mistral-nemo~ or another LLM that supports tool calling.
You will also need to have ~fuzzel~ installed.
To use this program, install the dependencies in ~requirements.txt~ and run ~main.py~.
* Current Status
All of the runtime-only options from ~swaymsg~ are supported, however only a handful of them can be active at a time when using smaller LLMs.
If you'd like to activate more of them, add functions from the comment above the ~tools~ list to the list.
Be careful in adding functions, as adding too many can cause the LLM to output gibberish
* License
This program is licensed under GPLv3 or Later.
